# Machine Learning with CUDA

This project aims to leverage the parallel computing capabilities of CUDA to enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms. By offloading computations to the GPU, we can achieve significant speedups in training and inference times. A comparation with the implementation on CPU is also provided.


## Installation
